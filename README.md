##Changelog
###Version 0.2
Fixed all broken functions. The first stable pre-release, but by no means complete.

###Version 0.11
Fixed some 0.1 release errors.

###Version 0.1
First public release. Has functions for dmails, wiki entries, and image posts. This version hasn't been thoroughly tested as of yet and, as such, isn't considered stable.
